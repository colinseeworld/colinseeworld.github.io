            Sólheimajökull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Mýrdalsjökull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's
            most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier only adding to
            the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in real contact with the true
            reason behind the name Ice-land!
