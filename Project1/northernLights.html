            The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more
            accessible
            places if you’d like to take in these light shows yourself.
            For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55° and low
            light
            pollution. Find your magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.
        </p>

            In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not
            necessarily
            the
            best time. Near equinoxes in March and September, the Earth’s magnetic field lets more solar particles
            interact
            with
            the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant
            temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
