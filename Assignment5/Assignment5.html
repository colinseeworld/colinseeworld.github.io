            <p class="description description-dog para">The Pembroke Welsh Corgi is a cattle herding dog breed that
                originated
                in Pembrokeshire, Wales. Two breeds known as a Welsh Corgi and Cardigan
                Welsh Corgi, both descend from the line of northern spitz-type dogs. Pembroke Welsh Corgis are
                famous as the preferred breed of Queen Elizabeth II, who has owned more than 30 during her reign.
                Although these dogs have been favoured by British royalty for more than seventy years, among the
                British
                public, they have recently fallen into decline in terms of popularity and demand.</p>

            <p class="description description-cat para">The British Shorthair is the pedigreed version of the
                traditional
                British
                domestic cat, with a distinctively stocky body, dense coat, and broad face. The most familiar
                color
                variant is the "British Blue", a solid grey-blue coat, orange eyes, and a medium-sized tail. The
                breed has also been developed in a wide range of other colours and patterns, including tabby and
                colorpoint.</p>
